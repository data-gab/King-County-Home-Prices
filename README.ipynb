    "A property investor is looking to \"flip\" houses in King County, WA for profit. \"Flipping houses\" is a term used for the action of buying property (in this case houses) that are in poor to average conditions in a good, well-established neighborhood (most likely in a expensive housing market) for cheap and renovating those houses and selling them for higher than they were bought for in order to make profit. The property investor wants to know if King County, WA is a good housing market to invest in and flip houses for profit."

    "I would recommend the property investor to flip houses in these zipcodes so that they can make more profit off of their rennovations. These a majority of the zipcodes reside outside of the main city of Seattle, WA. These zipcodes are beneficial for home owners who have families or do not want to live within the hustle and bustle of the city and are looking for a more tranquil environment, without being too far from the city. Being close to Seattle is a major attraction to many home buyers since it is most likely where they work or where more job opportunitites are available."

    "The above graphics show that the price of the houses increases as the grade increases. This makes sense since most home buyers are looking to buy homes that have little or no rennovation to be done. Even though the building grades range from 1-13, after removing outliers in the data, we found that a majority of homes sold in King County were from grades 5-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "I would recommended to the stakeholder to not hold back on construction and rennovations. As you can see from the chart and graphics provided above, the homes that sell at the highest price are homes with grades of 11. A grade of 11 is described as \"Custom design and higher quality finish work, with added amenities of solid woods, bathroom fixtures and more luxurious options.\" This shows that home buyers are willing to pay more for a home that is well constructed and higher quality. The property investor can cheap out on renovations and create an average house, but they will not see a huge return on investment. If the property owner rennovates the homes to have a building range from 9-13, I believe they will see a great return on investment."

This makes sense since most home buyers are looking to buy homes that are in good condition so that they do not have to further renovate or deal with construction issues. Even though the building conditions range from 1-5, after removing outliers in the data, we found that a majority of homes sold in King County had condition ratings from 2-5, which makes since since no one want to buy a home that is seriously deteriorated and needs many repairs like homes of poor condition (1 condition rating). A condition rating of 5 seems to be the most profitable. it seems that houses at condition 3 sell higher than houses at condition 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "I would recommend that the property investor flip homes in conditions 2-3 so that they can negotiate a lower price with the seller. Using the data I obtained, I would recommend the home owner to rennovate the home to the highest possible condition, being 5, which is described as \"Excellent maintenance and updating on home. Not a total renovation\", which would help them to sell the house at a higher price."
